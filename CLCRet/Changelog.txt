-Improved AOE mode detection. 
-Fixed a bug with range detection if you were not specced into Rebuke (For Shame!)
-Added alternating colors to index of abilities to help the user discern different abilities
-Reorganized the options menu: The "skill button" positioning settings were moved to be with the HUD position settings. This should help users figure out how to customize it easier. 
-Removed strings that are likely never to see use under any scenario, due to upcoming changes to Divine Hammer in 11.2
-Updated to .TOC file to indicate the addon is ready for 11.2.0
